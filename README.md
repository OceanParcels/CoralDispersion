# CoralDispersion
Repository for Reint Fischer's thesis project on dispersion around corals

The code referred to in the methods section of the thesis is located in the following files:
explfunctions.py all functions used in different steps of the process
preprocessing.py evaluating the CFD model output to determine objects and distances and direction to each object in the fluid domain
simulation_repeat.py Parcels particle tracking simulation to analyse the volume fluxes
simulation.py Parcels particle tracking simulation to define the network
postprocessing.py Calculation of the volume fluxes and network

The figures from the results and discussion section of the thesis are from the Jupyter Notebooks.
